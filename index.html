        <p class="para"> I have a lot of hobbies! I enjoy playing badminton, drawing, talking to my friends, writing, but my favorite is reading. Reading is a lot fun! Sitting down on the couch and reading a good book is one of the best feelings in the world. Plus, reading is also really good for you! It helps expand your vocabulary as well as your knowledge. Fiction books like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson are my favorites, but I like nonfiction too!
